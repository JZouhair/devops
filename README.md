## How to implement CI on your project with Travis for a Java project


### Link Github to Travis

1. Go to Travis-ci.com and Sign up with GitHub.
2. Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.
3. Click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
4. Add a .travis.yml (YAML format) file to your repository, at the source folder, to tell Travis CI what to do.
```
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.m2
language: java
jdk:
- oraclejdk8
```
5. Trigger a build manually on travis or make a push to the develop branch for an automated one.

You can get further information about travis build lifecycle customisation on [Travis Doc](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Customizing-the-Build-Step)
